TODO LIST:
	-Ensure Ruleset compliances (published on isis)

ERROR INVESTIGATION NOTES:
	-LINE 126 in MOD.rs: Confirm the indices of the secondary check in the "or"operator, this will be very hard to track otherwise
	-RMG and CMG have an error: cannot see moving king into final edge to right or bottom

	
CODE OVERVIEW:
	Program can be run normally for a 2-player human game, or with command line arguments 0-2 to specify the number of human players.
	Running with 3 will lead to an algorithmic trial setting; The program will expect a directory full of GameState files, which can be generated by the "utility" module.

	Alpha-Beta Approach requires a tree, where nodes are a game-state, and each Move-request is a branch.
	The tree is generated ONLY as needed to lower memory use, and save computation on tree generation whenever ab-search allows pruning.
	In the code, the defender is considered the maximizer.
	Consider the fq_game_update returning a king-capture bool to prevent yada yada
